# Hacker News Top Stories

A simple React app that pulls the top 20 stories from Hacker News and displays their titles and authors in a styled list.

## Technical Notes

- Simple React setup, using functional components with state/effect hooks.
- Use of CSS Animations for `LoadingIcon` component's 'bounce' effect.
- Async/await and Promise.all() to perform multiple `fetch()` requests to the Hacker News API.
